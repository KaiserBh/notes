The Spring framework is a set of tools that helps Java developers make their code easier to read, understand, and maintain. It does this by providing a bunch of pre-written code that developers can use in their own programs. This can save a lot of time and make it easier for developers to build complex applications.

Imagine that you are building a house. The Spring framework is like a box of Lego blocks. It gives you a bunch of different blocks that you can use to build your house. You can use as many or as few of the blocks as you want, and you can arrange them in any way you like. This makes it easier and faster to build your house, because you don't have to start from scratch every time.
