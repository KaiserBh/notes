In Java, an array list is a data structure that is used to store a collection of items. It is similar to an array, but it can grow and shrink dynamically as items are added or removed.

A narrow array list is simply an array list that is implemented in a way that only allows elements of a certain type to be stored in it. This is done by specifying the type of elements that the array list can hold when the array list is created.

Here is an example of how to create a narrow array list in Java:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Create a narrow array list that can only hold String elements
    ArrayList<String> names = new ArrayList<>();

    // Add some elements to the array list
    names.add("Alice");
    names.add("Bob");
    names.add("Eve");

    // Print the contents of the array list
    for (String name : names) {
      System.out.println(name);
    }
  }
}

```
In this example, the array list "names" can only hold String elements. If you try to add an element of any other type to the array list, you will get a compile-time error.
